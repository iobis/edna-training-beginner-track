## Using this template

### 1. Fork or copy this repository

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account, or use it as a template
(GitHub → "Use this template").

### 2. Edit `_variables.yml`

Open `_variables.yml` and fill in the lesson title, your name, the repo URL, and
any other metadata. These values are injected throughout the site — you only need
to update them in one place.

### 3. Edit the episode files

Episode files live in `episodes/`. Each file follows the same scaffold:

| Block | Callout type | Required? |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Learning objectives | `callout-note` | ✅ Always |
| Prerequisites | `callout-important` | If needed |
| Tips / notes | `callout-tip` | As needed |
| Exercise | `callout-caution` | ≥ 1 per episode |
| Inline instructor notes | `.instructor-only` div | Recommended |
| Key points | `callout-tip` | ✅ Always |

Do not remove the objectives or key points blocks — they are part of the
pedagogical contract with learners.

### 4. Add packages and data to `setup.qmd`

Edit `setup.qmd` with the actual R packages and data download instructions for
your lesson. Test that a clean R environment can follow these steps from scratch.

### 5. Add extended instructor notes

Per-episode instructor notes live in `instructor/notes-NN.qmd`. These are only
rendered in the instructor build. Use them for pacing guidance, common errors,
discussion prompts, and notes from past deliveries.

### 6. Build and preview

```bash
# Learner site (default)
quarto preview

# Instructor site
quarto preview --profile instructor
```

### 7. Publish

GitHub Actions can publish both sites automatically. The learner site goes to
`gh-pages` and the instructor site to `gh-pages/instructor/`.

A starter workflow is available at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
(not yet included — raise an issue or PR if you need it).

## Pedagogical framework

This lesson design follows the principles of
[The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org):

- **Backward design** — write learning objectives first, then build content that
  achieves them.
- **Bloom's taxonomy verbs** — objectives use verbs like *construct*, *apply*,
  *interpret* rather than passive verbs like *know* or *understand*.
- **Formative assessment** — exercises follow immediately after new concepts.
- **Key points** — every episode ends with a summary that mirrors the objectives.

These materials are not official Carpentries lessons, but the Carpentries framework
is acknowledged in the site footer and on the lesson landing page.
